In the story \textit{Naga o njawa ja mididi jo puaha}, two brothers come home from fasting in the mosque to learn that their mother has slaughtered their chicken against their previous order. They therefore leave their home but get separated. The younger brother loses his way and encounters an old woman who takes him in.
The motive of the old woman is also found in \textref{chapter:text01} and \textref{chapter:text05}.
