\subsection*{The \textit{biara} plant}

Once the mother went to her garden, and she urged her daughter, saying: ``Nene, when your brother cries, give him food to eat, only don't give him my \textit{biara}.''

Then she went and after she had left he cried, and she gave him food, but he refused it, he only wanted the \textit{biara}, so she gave it to him so that he wouldn't cry anymore.

Look, after that the mother had come back, and she asked for her \textit{biara}, saying: ``How about my \textit{biara}?'' And they said: ``Mother, a moment ago, the little one cried for it, so I gave it to him.''

And the mother said: ``I urged you, I said: `Don't give him my \textit{biara}, even if he cries for it,' I said: `Even if you give him all the food available, until there is nothing left, don't give him my \textit{biara}.'{''} And she the daughter said: ``But mother, the food up there I gave to him, but he refused it, he wanted only the \textit{biara}.''

And she said: ``He has eaten my \textit{biara}, therefore I will go away,'' then she went away, and they said: ``Mother, the little one did eat the \textit{biara}, but don't go away.'' But she said: ``I refuse, I will go away.''

And they followed her, but she said: ``Don't follow me, so that you stay with your father,'' but they refused, they followed her, and the sister called, saying: ``Mother! the throat of the King of the Moluccas is dry, so nurse him first.''

And she, the mother, said: ``Return to your father and stay there,'' then she pressed out her milk for him in a palm leaf and they went landwards and she, the sister, nursed him, later his throat was dry again and they called for the mother: ``Mother, the throat of the King of the Moluccas is dry, so nurse him first again.'' Then she pressed out her breast into a palm leaf again, so they went landwards and she, the sister, first nursed him, later his throat was dry again, and the sister called, saying: ``Mother, the throat of the King of the Moluccas is dry, so nurse him first,'' and she again pressed out her breast into a palm leaf for him, and they went away and she, the sister, nursed him first; later his throat was dry again, and they called: ``Mother, the throat of the King of the Moluccas is dry, so nurse him first,'' there on the stones inland was one house and there she waited for them. And they went landwards and she nursed him so that he was completely satisfied, and she said: ``Go ahead, return home,'' and they said: ``Mother, how are we supposed to return?'' And she broke off half of her breast for him. And she urged them, saying: ``Take this half of my breast for him, so that you may nurse him with it, but when he doesn't nurse anymore, then plant the breast.'' Then when he did not nurse anymore, they planted it.

And look, afterwards it sprouted, and later the children climbed it, but they did not fall down from it.

And look, then it blossomed, and it bore as fruit sarongs, white shirts, pants, \textit{bajus}, choppers, hoes, axes, beads, silver rings, gold rings, hairpins, earrings, ear pendants, anklets.

And what marvels the world holds, up there the tree bore them as fruits, and from the top a chest hung down.

And look, they opened it up and there was the mother herself.
