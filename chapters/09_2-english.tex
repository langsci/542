 \subsection*{She is stabbed by a Kris}

There was a maiden and her house was extremely high and it had only one pole.

A young man came to court her and she had closed her door, so he entered through the gable. And his kris fell and stabbed her, and he used his handkerchief as a bandage for her wound. Then he fled, going landwards to his mother and he said: ``Mother, make delicious food for me, because I've caused an accident for someone's child.''

And the next day, the girl's family went landwards to fetch him, and they brought her seawards, they came seawards and said: ``Maybe your kris has stabbed her?'' And he said: ``That's true, my kris stabbed her; I entered through the gable.'' And they said: ``You have to pay for her death.'' And he said: ``Don't kill me, but bury her with me.'' And they buried them.

And after three days they came to look for them, and look, they came and down inside their grave they played the flute.

And they dug their way down into the grave and they were there, and they were alive again.
