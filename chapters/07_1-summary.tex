In \textit{O Biara} a mother leaves her children because her daughter has fed the mother's \textit{biara} plant to her brother. The children follow her since the son needs to be nursed by his mother. Finally, the mother cuts off one of her breasts and the children plant it. The breast grows into a magical tree that spouts all manner of clothes and jewelry -- and finally the mother herself.
