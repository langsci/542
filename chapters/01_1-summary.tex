\textit{O lagudi ma howo'o wo djaga-djaga'a} starts out as a story about an abandoned boy who is taken in by a mysterious woman. In the middle of the story, the narrative focus shifts to seven princesses, one of whom is courted by the \textit{legundi} fruit guardian. I am not sure whether the \textit{legundi} fruit guardian and the abandoned boy are supposed to be one and the same person.
