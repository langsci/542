\textit{O Uho} is about a princess who marries a man disguised as a cuscus. Their children are taken away by her envious sisters and raised by an eccentric and cannibalistic general and his wife. Having escaped them as well as an presumptuous king, they are finally reunited with their parents and their father turns out to be a king as well. 

\textit{O Uho} shares with the story \textit{O Gogunane} the motive of a human disguised as an animal. But in contrast to the ants in \textref{chapter:text04}, the cuscus is not a trickster.
